#### Debate 1: Decrease Age Limit for Presidency to 35
The age limit for becoming the president of a country is determined by the constitution or laws of that particular country. While it is possible to decrease the age limit to 35, it would require constitutional or legislative amendments. Lowering the age limit could potentially bring new and younger voices into the political arena, allowing for fresh perspectives and ideas. It might also encourage greater youth participation in politics and governance. However, there are arguments on both sides of this issue.

**Pros:**
- New and younger voices in politics.
- Fresh perspectives and ideas.
- Greater youth participation in politics.

**Cons:**
- Need for experience and maturity.
- Potential lack of life and professional experience.
- Necessary wisdom and judgment for presidency.

Ultimately, the decision to decrease the age limit for presidential eligibility should be carefully considered, taking into account the specific circumstances and needs of each country.
